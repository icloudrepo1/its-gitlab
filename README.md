## what is gitlab ?
============================

GitLab is a web-based platform for version control and collaborative software development. 

It integrates a variety of tools that developers and teams can use to manage and track their codebase, automate workflows, and collaborate efficiently. 

GitLab uses Git, a distributed version control system, to manage code repositories.


## components of GitLab
===============================


#### 1. Version Control

GitLab is built on Git, allowing teams to store and manage their source code in repositories. 

It supports branching, merging, and other common version control features that allow multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously.

#### 2. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

GitLab has powerful CI/CD tools built-in, enabling developers to automate the process of testing, building, and deploying applications. 

Whenever code is pushed to the repository, GitLab can automatically run tests, build the project, and deploy it to different environments.

#### 3. Issue Tracking

GitLab provides an integrated issue tracking system, allowing teams to track bugs, tasks, and feature requests within the platform. 

Developers can link issues to commits, branches, and merge requests, creating a seamless workflow for managing development tasks.

#### 4. Merge Requests (MRs)

GitLabâ€™s Merge Requests are similar to "pull requests" in other systems. 

They allow team members to propose changes to the codebase. 

Other team members can review the changes, discuss them, and approve or suggest improvements before they are merged into the main codebase.

#### 5. Project Management Tools

GitLab has built-in tools for project management, such as Kanban boards, milestones, and epics. 

This allows teams to organize their work, track progress, and manage releases in a structured way.

#### 6. Security and Compliance

GitLab includes features like static code analysis, dependency scanning, and container scanning to help teams identify security vulnerabilities in their code and dependencies. 

It also includes compliance tools to help with audit trails and regulatory requirements.

#### 7. Auto DevOps

Auto DevOps is a feature in GitLab that helps automate the entire DevOps lifecycle, from code creation and testing to deployment and monitoring, using best practices.

#### 8. Self-hosted and Cloud-hosted

GitLab is available both as a self-hosted version (where you can install and manage GitLab on your own infrastructure) and as a cloud-hosted version (GitLab.com, where GitLab takes care of the hosting).

#### 9. Collaboration Tools

GitLab provides collaboration features like wikis, code reviews, and discussions to help teams communicate and collaborate better while working on the same codebase.

#### 10. Integrations

GitLab integrates with a wide range of tools and services like Slack, Kubernetes, Jira, and more to provide a smooth and connected development workflow.
